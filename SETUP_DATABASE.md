# 🗄️ Database Setup Instructions

Your MediVIX application is ready to run, but you need to execute the database schema in Supabase first.

## ✅ Current Status
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: Configured with your Supabase and Mistral credentials
- ✅ **Dependencies**: All packages installed successfully
- ✅ **Application**: Running on http://localhost:3002
- ✅ **Connection**: Can connect to Supabase (verified via health check)
- ❌ **Database Schema**: Not yet executed

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Execute Database Schema

1. **Open your Supabase Dashboard**: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. **Navigate to your project**: `iebbzuydrnexcithqupg`
3. **Go to SQL Editor** (in the left sidebar)
4. **Create a new query**
5. **Copy and paste** the entire contents of `database/schema.sql`
6. **Click "Run"** to execute the schema

### 2. Verify Setup

After running the schema, test the setup:

```bash
# Test the health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3002/api/health

# You should see: "database": "connected"
```

### 3. What the Schema Creates

The schema will create:
- **4 main tables**: patients, appointments, visit_templates, medical_history
- **Sample data**: 5 test patients and visit templates
- **Indexes**: For optimal performance
- **RLS policies**: For security
- **Triggers**: For automatic timestamp updates

### 4. Sample Data Included

- **5 test patients** with medical history
- **5 visit templates** (Annual Physical, Sick Visit, etc.)
- **Sample appointments** and medical history records

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If the schema execution fails:
1. Make sure you're in the correct Supabase project
2. Check that your project has the PostgreSQL database enabled
3. Try running the schema in smaller chunks if needed

### If connection still fails after schema:
1. Verify your environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Check the Supabase project URL and anon key
3. Ensure Row Level Security policies are properly set

## 📋 After Database Setup

Once the database is ready, you can:
1. ✅ **Use the health check**: `GET /api/health`
2. 🔄 **Continue development**: API endpoints and UI components
3. 🧪 **Test AI features**: With sample patient data
4. 📱 **Build the full application**: All features will work
